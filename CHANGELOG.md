# Changelog

What changed in the simulator between published versions. Every run folder records the versions that
produced it (`manifest.json`, `karamaniya/versions.py`), and `docs/ENGINEERING_BACKLOG.md` keeps the
task-by-task record with the tests behind each item.

## Since engine-5 (on `main`)

The world engine, the agent prompts and the psychology are unchanged (`WORLD_ENGINE` 5, `AGENT_PROMPT` 5,
`PSYCHOLOGY` 4): a run with default settings sends byte for byte the prompts the `engine-5` tag sends,
which `tests/test_prompt_freeze.py` checks. What is new is measurement, and features a run must turn on.

Measurement

- `python -m karamaniya tokens`: where a run's tokens went, by phase, seat and prompt section; the counts
  the providers reported (input, output, cache reads and writes, reasoning); the cost of one simulated
  month with the setup apart; each seat's characters per provider-counted token; a combined rate and
  projection over several runs; and a simulation of how much of the input a prompt cache could reuse.
- `tools/cache_replay.py`: replays a run's prompts through a local Ollama server and counts, from the
  server's log, the prompt tokens it really evaluated.
- Every model call has a `call_id`, written to both `log.jsonl` and `prompts.jsonl`, and records the
  cache, reasoning and effort fields where the provider reports them (zero or empty otherwise).

Opt-in features (off by default; recorded in `config.json` and the manifest's `token_saving` when on,
and named by `manifest.divergences()`)

- `[run.tokens]`: `layout = "cache_friendly"`, `schema_hint = "compact" | "auto"`,
  `briefing = "on_demand"`, `wakeups = "on_events"` with `max_quiet_months`.
- `[run] foreign_cabinet_backend`: one fixed model for the two foreign cabinets.
- `[[seat]] effort_by_phase`, and `price_cache_read` / `price_cache_write` for cached input.

Fixes

- Codex CLI seats counted their reasoning tokens twice in `output_tokens` (Codex's own count already
  includes them). In engine-5 runs a Codex seat's output, and its cost when it had a `price_out`, is
  overstated by its reasoning tokens; input counts were right.
- The run report's header printed "null" when a run had no outcome yet.

Measured results and their limits are in [docs/TOKEN_EFFICIENCY.md](docs/TOKEN_EFFICIENCY.md).
